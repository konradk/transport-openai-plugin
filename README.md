# Transport OpenAI Plugin

Plugin for ChatGPT whose task is to answer questions about public trasnport timetables via ChatGPT. It uses data in [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) format. I used the data of [public transport timetables in Wrocław](https://transitfeeds.com/p/mpk-wroc-aw/663), published by MPK Wrocław.
